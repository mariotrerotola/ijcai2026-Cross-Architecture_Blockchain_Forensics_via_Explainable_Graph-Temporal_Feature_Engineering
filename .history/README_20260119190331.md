# Cross-Architecture Blockchain Forensics via Explainable Graph-Temporal Feature Engineering

This repository builds graph and temporal features from blockchain activity and trains interpretable ML models for two tasks:

- Bitcoin: wallet-level fraud detection.
- Ethereum (ERC-20): scam token detection.

The code is split into two pipelines:
- `Bitcoin_Fraud_Detection/`
- `Ethereum_ERC20_Scam_Detection/`

### Data availability

Datasets are not included. For access requests, contact: `mario.trerotola@polito.it`.

### Environment and dependencies

Install dependencies from the repository root:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Some components need extra runtime setup:
- Playwright (used for ChainAbuse scraping): run `playwright install` after `pip install`.

### Repository structure

- `Bitcoin_Fraud_Detection/`: data acquisition, feature computation, dataset assembly, and modeling notebooks (RF/SVM/MLP with explainability).
- `Ethereum_ERC20_Scam_Detection/`: token transfer extraction, graph-temporal feature extraction, and modeling notebooks (BRF/MLP/SVM).

### Reproducibility notes

- Several scripts and notebooks accept environment variables to override paths or credentials (API keys, cookies, proxy URLs).
- Checkpointing is supported in long-running stages (e.g., transfer extraction, ChainAbuse scraping).

### Citation

If you use this repository in academic work, cite the corresponding paper (bibliographic entry TBD).
